# Bottle Log

Hosted on Heroku, live at `bottle.rotondozer.com`

## Access

Currently, this app only serves myself and my family (and anyone that cares for my son). There is no place to create an account, but that's something I plan on adding.

## Deploy

Currently just using the default Heroku commands to deploy via the command line:
`git push heroku main`

I'd like to add GitHub actions to deploy, to open up contribution.
